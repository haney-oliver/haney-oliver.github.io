      My name is Oliver Haney and I study Computer Sciences at Stetson University in Deland, Florida. I am currently going into my
      senior year now, and have learned a lot since I first got into any sort of programming. I mainly specialize in web applications,
      but have been recently been branching out into other computer science related fields such as artificial intelligence and machine-
      learning, and cybersecurity. It is my hope to unify these three areas of study into my senior project, which I am starting this 
      semester, where I intend to build a machine leaning platform for malicious network traffic classification, which will wrapped
      in a web app for an easy to use interface. I have about three years of experience with Java, and it has quickly become my best
      language. I am very familiar with the Dropwizard framework, which I use almost daily in the creation of web applications. 
      I have knowledge in other programming languages, such as python, c++, c#, and others, but Java remains my most popular choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on into my programming career, I grossly overestimated my abilty to be useful on a software team, and after not receiving
      a single in person interview after many applications, I realized how little I truly knew and that I would need to change a lot as soon as possible. After that,
      I became motivated to learn Java, C++, and Python, which I did. I learned more about best programming practices as I attempted to
      implement more and more complex projects, and discovered new ways to write as little code as possible. I learned that abstraction is a 
      powerful tool, but I still lacked the experience to use it to guide my programming in a meaningful and efficient way. As I
      accumulated these new skills across a variety of technologies and areas of study, I felt I was ready to apply for more internships.  
      LSQ gave me my first internship opportunity, and it was the most amazing internship. The management including my direct boss were
      extremely accomidating, encouraging, and generally helpful in my development as a software engineer. The pay was good, and I got to seek 
      guidance from some of the smartest people I have ever met. At the end of my initial term with LSQ, I had improved so much that they 
      offered to extend my internship hire me on post-graduation. The total length of time that I at LSQ was about 10 months, and these 
      were the months that have molded my current skill set, and made me actually useful and beneficial to a software team.
